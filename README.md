# knights-travails

A chess knight path finding algorithm that determines the shortest possible path for a knight to move from any square to any other square on a standard 8Ã—8 chessboard. This project implements graph theory concepts, specifically breadth-first search, to efficiently find the minimal number of moves required and visualize the complete path.
The knight's unique L-shaped movement (two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular) creates an interesting path finding challenge. This implementation represents the chessboard as a graph where each square is a node, and the knight's possible moves from each square form the edges between nodes.
